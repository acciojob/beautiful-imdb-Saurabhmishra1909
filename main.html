            When the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, 
            Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability 
            to fight injustice. Christian Bale delivers a powerful performance as Batman, while 
            Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker earned him a posthumous Academy Award for 
            Best Supporting Actor. Christopher Nolan's masterpiece redefined the superhero genre 
            with its dark tone and complex characters.
